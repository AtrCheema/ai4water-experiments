This repository contains examples which illustrate usage of Experiments module for 
model comparison optimization.

The HyperOpt module is part of [ai4water](https://ai4water.readthedocs.io) library 
which exposes `Experiments` class to the user.

If your results are quite different or you encounter errors during running the examples,
please check the versions of all the third party libraries before reporting an issue.
